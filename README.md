# Terraform

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp.

Cloud infrustructure and resources can be deployed using code via Terraform.

CLI commands:
terraform init -- Initialize directory, pull down providers.
terraform plan -- Display the plan to deploy infrastructure.
terraform apply -- Apply the desired changes in the plan to the infrastructure and create a state file of the changes.
terraform destroy -- Destroy the existing infrastructure as per the state file & the terraform plan.

In this repository, we aim to understand Terraform concepts by the methods of implementation with the help of the ('Terraform on AWS with SRE & IaC DevOps | Real-World 20 Demos')[https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-on-aws-with-sre-iac-devops-real-world-demos/] course.
